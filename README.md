# battleship-game
A very basic terminal-ran battleship game from the codeacademy python tutorial that I expanded upon and will continue to expand upon

Ran with the following commmand: 

python3 battleship.py (Number of turns) (board size)

Example for 20 turns and board size of 6:

python3 battleship.py 20 6

If the turn amount is left blank, the game defaults to 5. If board size is left blank, the size defaults to 5.

to do: 

  -error handling for player ship placement
 
  -customizable grid size (sorta done, might give option for different row and column size)
